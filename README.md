Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

Please use the code to genarate inverse matrix. 
Setps are as follows - 
Create a matrix
pass that matrix through makeCacheMatrix and store it
Pass the stored object via cacheMean to get mean
Example - 
p <- matrix(data = c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) 
q <- makeCacheMatrix(p)
cacheSolve(q)
